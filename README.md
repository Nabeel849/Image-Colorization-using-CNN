# Image Colorization Project

This project leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to colorize black and white images. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a model that predicts color information from grayscale inputs.

## Features
- Colorizes grayscale images using a trained CNN.
- Processes images from a specified directory.

## Usage

1. Place your grayscale images in the `images/` folder.
2. Run the training script to train the model:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow opencv-python scikit-image
